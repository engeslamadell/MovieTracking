## Information
i have used Hooks and the context API to manage the state and the data flow, but let me know if you want it with the legacy class component or even with Redux

i have used json-server https://github.com/typicode/json-server to setup a kind of mock Database

i have used bootstrap for only the Accordion component and Modal

i have used the standars way of styling because of the time frame

## Installation Instruction
Download the project
run " yarn install "
run " yarn jsonDB "
    i have selected the port 3001 as 3000 will be taken by react, if 3001 is busy by any other service you can change the port easily from package.json
run " yarn start "

## Thank You
i will appreciate if you take the time to give me your feedback
